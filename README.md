# OpenCVPythonRAG

## Overview

OpenCVPythonRAG is a project aimed at building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenCV's Python documentation as the knowledge base. The goal is to create an interactive tool that can answer questions and provide code suggestions from the OpenCV documentation, leveraging natural language understanding.

## Features

- Automated extraction of OpenCV's Python documentation.
- Preprocessing of documentation for efficient retrieval.
- Embedding generation for natural language querying.
- RAG pipeline setup for question-answering.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need Python 3.8+ and a few Python libraries.

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SergioPulidoC/OpenCVPythonRAG.git
cd OpenCVPythonRAG
```
2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# For Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# If you're on Windows, use:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. **Install the required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
